In the first post of this series, l will be covering two common challenges that are usually encountered by vulnerability managment teams. These challenges include how to efficiently prioritize findings from thousands of vulnerabilities and correlate/track vulnerabilities from different sources [i.e penetration test reports or security testing tools like Nessus, Acunetix, Burpsuite etc.].

## CHALLENGE 1: Prioritizing Findings from Thousands of Vulnerabilities

In my experience, the below prioritization process has been very effective in ensuring that true high-risk vulnerabilities are remediated first.

As shown above, the first thing after identifying high CVE/CVSS scores on a critical business asset list is to filter for three (3) checks with increasing order of priority and then work with the smallest sample size first. Check:
* If exploit code has been written or published for it
* If the vulnerability has been exploited in recent real-world attacks
* Finally, look at the attack profile to identify if controls are currently in place to mitigate the vulnerability.

For example, the below filter was able to narrow down 64 vulnerabilities to 1 vulnerability. This process provides a practical way of prioritizing remediation of the most serious vulnerabilities first.

## CHALLENGE 2: Correlation and Tracking of Vulnerabilities from Different Sources

Basically, we want to incorporate findings from a variety of security testing data sources into a centralized tool and track them to remediation. Looking at the diagram below from left to right, there are three main tasks needed to solve this:
* Import scan results from security tools / correlate findings.
* Add vulnerabilities from penetration test reports. (It is important that pentesting teams deliver reports in a CSV format, in addition to the typical PDF reports.)
* Push vulnerabilities/findings to the tracker and synchronize changes.

I would advise using DefectDojo to implement this, it can be used in large environments.

Let us do a high-level walkthrough of the previously mentioned tasks.
