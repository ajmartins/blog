<p>Gaining visibility into an application’s attack surface is really important in identifying risk areas. In cases of an attack, it can also help in determining root cause i.e. the part(s) of an attack surface that was the origin of the breach.</p>

<p>In using an attacker’s perspective through reconnaissance, you can proactively identify attack surfaces. This will always help in quickly noticing attack surface changes or deciding on the best strategy for minimizing risk.</p>

<h2 id="football-analogy-attack-surface-identification-via-recon">Football Analogy: Attack Surface Identification via Recon</h2>

<p>Let’s do an illustration by using analogies from the beautiful game of football, specifically using a phase of play that has been well discussed in the last couple of years: <code class="highlighter-rouge">The Build-Up Play</code>. Think of this as any football game where in building up from the back, <code class="highlighter-rouge">the goal is to move the ball (in this case our workflow/process) from our half to the opponent’s half</code>.</p>

<p>Befittingly we’ll be using the 4-3-3 formation to show this, used by some of the greatest and most celebrated teams of all time; Ajax 1971–73, Bayern 1973–76, Barcelona 2008-2012.</p>

  <p>[6] SUBDOMAIN ENUMERATION</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ATTACK SURFACE (DNS Information)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>There is great value in having complete knowledge of all DNS properties (e.g. subdomains) mapped to an application. Subdomain enumeration is a process that involves a lot of open source intelligence (OSINT), by combing various sources for valuable data like ip addresses, whois info, asn, zone records, email addresses etc. A company could have subdomains that they are not aware of, which affects visibility into those subdomains and could make them less secure. A good tool for finding, tracking and automating the DNS discovery process is Amass.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Attack surfaces change all the time from the introduction of new app servers, to changes in the software packages running on them and so on. Therefore it is crucial that different strategies be taken to keep accurate information of an applications attack surface. Today we have looked at enumerating attack surfaces via a typical recon workflow, but beyond identification it is also necessary to do analysis for determining high risk areas based on the different functionalities of the application. To read further on this, I recommend going through the owasp cheatsheet for attack surface analysis (https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Attack_Surface_Analysis_Cheat_Sheet.md).</p>
